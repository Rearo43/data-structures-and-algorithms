# `Link Lists`
> [code](linked-list.test.js)
### Challenge
- [] Class to store value and pointer to next
- [] Have a Node that is Head
- From starting with empty Linked List ...
    - [] Take an argument, adds new node with value of head (O(1) Time performance)
    - [] Method takes in value returns boolean result if value exists in list (anywhere)
    - [] Method no agrument, returns string of list ex. "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
    - [] Throw custome error
- Tests for ...
    - [x] Instantiate empty list
    - [x] Add into list from front and back while keeping all Nodes
    - [x] Head is recognized as first Node
    - [x] Insert multiple Nodes
    - [] Boolean result for finding values in list
    - [] Return string of all Nodes in list ex. "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
