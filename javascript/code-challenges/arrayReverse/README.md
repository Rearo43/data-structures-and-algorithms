# `Array Reverse`

### Challenge
- [x] Take in an array of number

- [x] The output should be the given array reversed

- [x] Can't use any type of reverse method

### Approach & Efficiency
- Every array has index positions and they're the same order all the time across the board. I used the sort method and sorted by the index position of each number. I think this was extremely effective because it can be used on arrays of numbers or strings of any length.

### Solution
